# React Find All Pairs

## Description

Find All Pairs is a multi-platform browser game where you can test your memory and concentration skills.
The game objective is pretty simple: find all card pairs before time is up.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, making it accessible and enjoyable on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Seamless gameplay**: Instead of loading screens between game sessions players experience smooth animations of dealing and collecting cards and theme transitions.

- **Unique Game Sessions**: Integrated two different APIs with random images, current game card pool is greater than the amount of cards a player gets to play in a single game session and even if you get the same set of cards as in a previous game session, card placements are randomized.

- **Intuitive Game Logic**: The project incorporates intuitive game logic that keeps track of your progress, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

- **Tracking progress**: The best results are recorded on local devices.

## Getting Started

To get started and play Find All Pairs you can visit [the project demo](https://reactfindallpairs.netlify.app/) and start enjoying the game right away.

If you want to test or play with the code yourself:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vvklimov/react-find-all-pairs.git
```

2. Make sure you have installed Node.js and npm:

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v
```

If you see the versions, then everything should work, if not, install it.
In my case it was:

```bash
sudo snap install node --classic
```

3. Access the project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Replace /path/to/your/project with the actual path to the directory where you have cloned or created your project. For example, if you cloned the project to a directory called my-project in your home directory, you would use:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Run the local server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will get a link that looks like this: <http://localhost:5173/>
